Labs for COSC 130: Computer Organization at UTK

- Lab 2 (Bitset) - To simulate bitwise commands (test, clear, set) with bitwise operators (&, |, ~, <<, >>) and a vector.
- Lab 3 (Binary Arithmetic) - Replicate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus by manipulating bits
- Lab 4 (BMP) - Read in a bitmap file and write a new one after inverting the colors and flipping the input.
- Mips - Simulate a MIPS processor using a given binary file with assembly instructions and translating/running those instructions in C++.
